WalrusDict
==========

WalrusDict is dictionary lookup and flashcard creation solution useful for language learners. It is composed of an Android app and a web service.

Service components:
 * service.js:
	http api interface
 * ntree.cpp:
	cpp library implementing a n-way tree to access the dictionaries
	it is accessed through nodejs ffi bindings
 * rogueclient.py:
	interface to libanki to create cards and sync

Currently it is hard (but not impossible) to setup because the dictionaries are not freely redistributable and it requires you to setup your anki account separately.
